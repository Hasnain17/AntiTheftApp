## Overview

Anti-Theft Mobile App is an innovative Kotlin-based mobile application designed to enhance the security of your phone. It leverages the power of Android's foreground services to detect unauthorized access or tampering with your device. Whether your phone is in your pocket, charging, or left on a table, FunPrime ensures your peace of mind by alerting you of any unwanted interference.

## Features

- **Pocket Removal Detection**: Activates an alarm siren when the phone is removed from your pocket.
- **Charger Removal Detection**: Sounds an alarm when the charger is disconnected from your phone.
- **Motion Detection**: Triggers an alarm when the phone is moved from a stable position.

## Functionality

- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: The main activity displays three buttons to activate each service.
- **Foreground Services**: The app runs as a foreground service, ensuring continuous operation even when closed.
- **Alarm Dismissal Mechanism**: Alarms can be silenced by locking and then unlocking the phone's screen. No need for PIN or pattern input.
